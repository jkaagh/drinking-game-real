for when i return to this project in 8 months and have forgotten what the fuck anything is.

if your server says: Error: querySrv ENOTFOUND _mongodb._tcp.cluster0.tcn5q.mongodb.net
its because mongodb thingie is sleeping.


i have all my shit on kanbanflow, and there is also links to the gptchat chichanery.

make sure to put in the ip trying to access the server in mongodb atlas.
